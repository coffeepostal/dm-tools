# DM Tools

These are my dungeon (game) mastering tools that I've collected from around the internet. I've attributed (and linked) to their original creators, in many cases, I've transcribed them into different formats (mostly JSON) to be easily accessed within generators, randomizers, etc.

## Please, Support the Original Creators

I cannont stress this enough, our games are better because of these creators, and I've linked to them below AND in the individual documents.
